# Shopping Cart
A simple React shopping cart application where users can browse products, add them to a cart, view item counts, and remove items. Product data is served from a local JSON file via JSON Server, and the cart state is persisted using the localStorage API. The app uses the Context API to manage global state for products and cart items, making data easily accessible across components without prop drilling.
